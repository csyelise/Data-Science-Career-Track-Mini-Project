Over the course of working on this mini-project and the previous frequentist mini-project, you'll learn  The following list includes the topics you will become familiar with as you work through these two mini-projects:

The two mini-projects cover the fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference. Following topics are covered:

- the z-statistic
- the t-statistic
- the difference and relationship between the two
- the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences
- how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
- the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
- how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values
- how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
