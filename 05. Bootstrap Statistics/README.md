You've previously applied frequentist methods to calculate confidence intervals, p-values, and perform hypothesis tests. Frequentist methods use theoretical results to calculate what we expect would happen if experiments were to be run again and again and again. Now you've seen how you can do the same things using the bootstrap approach, which does not rely on such theory, and attendant assumptions, but instead literally does run experiments again and again and again.

In these exercises, you have:

- calculated the same confidence interval lower limit as you did previously
- tested the assumption that the variances of the two groups (insured vs. non-insured) were equal - something a bit harder to do using the frequentist method because of the nature of the sampling distribution for variance
- calculated the p-value for the difference between the means of the two groups and compared with the result obtained using the previous frequentist approach
- You are now well equipped to apply the bootstrap approach to a wide variety of problems. Just think about what conditions you wish to recreate in your simulated reruns.
