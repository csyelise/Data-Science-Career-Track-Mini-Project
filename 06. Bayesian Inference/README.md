In this exercise, we have postulated a distribution to describe the individual charge amounts for non-insured cases. This distribution has two required parameters, which we do not know, but we used PyMC3 to perform Bayesian inference to find our level of "belief" in a range of values for them. We then used the average parameter values to create one simulated data set of the same size as the original, but the distribution of our posteriors for these parameters will allow us to perform simulations of any sample size we desire and for a range of scenarios of different $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This could be a powerful tool to model different financial conditions for the hospital.

Well done making it through this tricky subject. Starting think Bayesian and starting to get to grips with something like PyMC3 is no easy task. As a data scientist, the most important thing is to be aware that this statistical approach exists, though you may not actually use this approach as much as you use the other approaches you've learned about. Still, we encourage you to think of ways that this approach could apply to the work that you do in this course and throughout your career.
